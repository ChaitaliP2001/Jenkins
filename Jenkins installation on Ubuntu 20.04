Prerequisites
To install Jenkins on Ubuntu 20.04, the following requirements must be met.

A server with at least 2 GB RAM and 2 cores.
The Ubuntu 20.04 OS installed.
All commands are executed as the root user. If you are a normal user, you must have access to and use the sudo command.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation : -

1.First, we should always update Ubuntu and all installed applications.

--root@host:~# apt update &&  apt upgrade -y

2.Install JDK
In order to install, configure, and use Jenkins, we need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. 
First, we check if we already have the JDK software installed on the server using the version command.

--root@host:~# java -version
            -bash: java: command not found

Now we can install the JDK.

--root@host:~# apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

Verify Java Version.
Lastly, we verify the Java version using this command.

-- root@host:~# java -version
openjdk version "11.0.9.1" 2020-11-04
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.9.1+1-Ubuntu-120.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.9.1+1-Ubuntu-120.04, mixed mode)


3.Install Jenkins-
Next, we install Jenkins itself. The Jenkins version contained in the standard Ubuntu packages is different from the latest available version. Therefore, we will install the newest version from the official site.

https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/

First, we add the gpg key to verify the authenticity of the software from the repository.

root@host:~# wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | apt-key add -
OK
root@host:~#

After this, we add the repository address to our /etc/apt/sources.list.d file. This list contains information on where to download and update the application. 

--root@host:~# sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
e>     /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'


4.Next, let’s update our package list again so that the apt package manager can find the software new repository.

--root@host:~# apt-get update

5.Now we can install Jenkins-

--+root@host:~# apt install jenkins -y

6.Start and Verify the Service

We have installed Jenkins.
Now we will start it using the systemctl system command.


--root@host:~# systemctl start jenkins


7.Set up Jenkins Users
Now let's start setting up our main user. Go to a browser and enter http://YOUR_IP_OR_DOMAIN:8080

YOUR_IP_OR_DOMAIN - list your domain name or IP address here. If you don’t know your IP address, you can verify it using the following command.

--root@host:~# ip a
